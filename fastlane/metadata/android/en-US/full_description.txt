Todoist is an excellent task tracking app, but has poor habit tracking capabilities. Loop Habit Tracker is an excellent habit tracking app, but has no task tracking capabilities.

Enter Todoist Habit Sync which automatically marks off habits in Loop Habit Tracker when you complete a recurring task in Todoist. Now you have the best of both worlds!

Here's how:
1. Open the app
2. Link your Todoist tasks to Loop Habits
3. Done! ðŸŽ‰
